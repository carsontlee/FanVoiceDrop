# FanVoice Drop Tool
### A Proof-of-Concept Tool to Transform Fan Recordings into Live Show Audio Clips using ElevenLabs API

## Overview
The **FanVoice Drop Tool** is a conceptual project aimed at enhancing fan engagement before and during live shows. Using ElevenLabs’ Voice AI technology, this tool allows artists and DJs to:

1. Collect voice recordings from fans before a show.
2. Use ElevenLabs’ API to generate custom phrases spoken in the fan’s voice.
3. Play these clips during live performances to create unforgettable moments for fans, while giving artists a fun, creative way to customize each show to their audience.

## Use Case
Imagine a DJ like Dom Dolla performing his song "San Francisco" at a show. In the original recording of the song, there is a voice that says "San Francisco, where's your disco" right before the beat drops. 

Instead, imagine a lucky fan's voice saying that same line, but "San Francisco" is swapped with the city the show is at.

Take it a step further - the fan's voice could say any custom hype phrase that the artist wants, inserted at any point in any song during the show. 

### Why This Matters
This proof-of-concept tool showcases the potential of utilizing voice AI to reimagine fan experiences and relationships between fans and artists. It highlights an innovative approach to fan engagement by making each performance interactive, unique, and unforgettable. 

The music industry is increasingly building products and experiences to serve the "superfan". What are superfans' wildest wishes that artists can make come true? One category of fan wishes is to be able to co-create with their favorite artists. Imagine hearing your voice layered creatively into your favorite artist's live set!

From the artist perspective, this tool opens up new possibilities for marketing and fan engagement. For example, artists can invite fans to submit voice recordings, with the chance to be featured as the lucky voice played during a show. Artists can also crowdsource creative text prompts from fans, further elevating this unique collaboration between the artist and fan. During a performance, voice AI unlocks unprecedented levels of recorded voice customization, creating moments of surprise and delight that fans crave.

Ultimately, voice AI empowers us to explore the limitless magic of music and create unforgettable memories together.
